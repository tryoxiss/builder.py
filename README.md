# builder.py
An extensive static site generator built in python. Designed for the real world, builder.py comes with components and a modern markdown compiler out of the box with minimal setup. Unlike most static site generators, it grows with you as your site needs do.

> **Important**
> We have migrated this repository to [codeberg](https://codeberg.org/tryoxiss/builder.py) due to github using public repos as AI training data. This repository will be completely purged at some point.
