# Meowing up the wrong scratching post

One day I was <em>absolutely <strong>intoxicated<strong/><em/> with love and wanted to do something <mark>special<mark/> so I went to hunt some birds<sub>like you always do?<sub/>.

I found a really nice tree that was about <sup>this tall<sup/> [^1], and it was so pretty! I went to "meow" at it and then a squrrel came down on me!

[1]: Approxamtely 6 maddies tall

I scratched it with some very <Spoiler>not<Spoiler/> vicious claws, and hissed at it!

I need to add some \<em>not tokens<em/> so lets _get that over with! Is this** enough?

this is a <em>test<em/> i*f you couldnt tell
